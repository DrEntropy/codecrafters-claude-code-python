This Dr Entropy's solutions to the
["Build Your own Claude Code" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/claude-code).

Claude Code is an AI coding assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to
understand code and perform actions through tool calls. 

As of Feb 2026 while this was in beta, we implemented Read, Write and Bash tool calls as well as simple agent loop. 

To try this yourself go to:
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Running tests

```sh
codecrafters test
```

# Runing locally
 

1. Ensure you have `uv` installed locally and get an API key from openrouter.ai. As an alternative you could use your openai key and modify the code appropriately
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
